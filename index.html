  If you've been in an airport, coffee shop, library or hotel recently, chances
 are you've been right in the middle of a wireless network. Many people also
 use wireless networking, also called WiFi or networking, to connect
 their computers at home, and some cities are trying to use the technology
 to provide free or low-cost Internet access to residents. In the near future,
 wireless networking may become so widespread that you can access the
 Internet just about anywhere at any time, without using wires.

 inexpensive. They're also unobtrusive unless you're on the lookout for a place
